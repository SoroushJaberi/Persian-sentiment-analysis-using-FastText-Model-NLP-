# Persian-sentiment-analysis-using-FastText-Model-NLP-
a program that can understand the emotions behind Persian text.(Natural Language Processing (NLP)).

# Code Explanation:
built a program that can understand the emotions behind Persian text. Let's break down how it works:

# Data Preparation:
start by getting my training data from a file called 'final_preprocessed.csv'.
make sure this data is clean and ready to use by removing unnecessary columns, checking for information about it, and ensuring there are no missing values.

# FastText Model:
Now, here's where the magic happens. I use a special tool called FastText. It's like a smart robot for understanding text.
FastText helps me create a model that learns to understand the emotions in text. For example, whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral.
FastText is really good at this because it's been trained on lots of text data and can understand the context of words.

# Training and Testing:
To make FastText work for my data, I have to train it. I show it lots of examples of text and tell it what emotion each piece of text represents.
But before I do that, I split my data into two parts: one for training and one for testing to see how well my model does.
After training, I test my model to see if it's good at predicting emotions in text.

# Model Score:
My model performs impressively well, with a score of 86%. This means that it correctly predicts the emotions in the text about 86% of the time. That's pretty accurate!

# Preprocessing for Testing Data:
To make predictions on new text, I also need to prepare the text in the same way as my training data. This involves cleaning up the text and making it neat.

# Making Predictions:
My trained FastText model can now look at new text and tell me what emotion it thinks is in there.
It can say if the text is "positive," "negative," or "neutral."

# Saving Results:
Finally, I save all these predictions in a file called 'total_testing.csv' so I can look at them later.

# Why FastText is Cool:
FastText is a great tool because it's really good at understanding text. It's fast and accurate, even if I don't have tons of training data.
It's like having a smart friend who can read lots of books and tell me what they're all about.
So, code is like having a language expert who can understand emotions in Persian text, and it's impressively accurate, scoring 86% in predicting emotions!
